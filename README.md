# Dark Mode Added to Build
* see `dark-mode-set up guide.md` on a working method I used -- happy to share these notes. 

After you have the repo

set up db (.env)

`composer update` <br>
`npm install && npm run dev` <br>
use `npm run watch` when you start wroking on your css to continually update without having to `run dev` each time you change some css. <br>
for small changes run `npm run dev` - remember to refresh your browser <br>
`php artisan key:generate` <br>
`php artisan storage:link` <br>
`php artisan migrate --seed` <br>
`php artisan serve` <br>
