# Dark Mode Added to Build
* see `dark-mode-set up guide.md` on a working method I used -- happy to share these notes. 

After you have the repo

set up db (.env)

`composer update`
`npm install && npm run dev`
use `npm run watch` when you start wroking on your css to continually update without haveing to `run dev` each time you change some css.
`php artisan key:generate`
`php artisan storage:link`
`php artisan migrate --seed`
`php artisan serve`
