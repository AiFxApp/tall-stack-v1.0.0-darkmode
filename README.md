# Dark Mode Added to Build

-   see `dark-mode-set up guide.md` on a working method I used -- happy to share these notes.

After you have the repo

set up db (.env)

`composer update`
<br>
`npm install && npm run dev`
<br><br>
(for small changes to css and js run `npm run dev` - remember to refresh your browser
<br>
use `npm run watch` when you start working on your css to continually update without having to `run dev` each time you change css / js.)
<br><br>
`php artisan key:generate`
<br>
`php artisan storage:link`
<br>
`php artisan migrate`
<br>
No Admin Seeder added - so go ahead and register then login.
<br>
`php artisan serve`
<br>

If you like this build - please give me a ⭐

This is a preview of the repo - Naturally there are a few things not in the repo: <br>
* Why?<br> 
* Becuase i am going to convert this into my official Website someday soon. 
Yes the one button look out of place 🤔 but actually you will see it is a bouncing button 😁<br><br>
